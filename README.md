# VIDEOGAME Example
This videogame example contains 2 projects (Frontend and API)

## Setup
README API NODE [link](API-NODE-GAME/README.md)

README FRONTEND [link](FRONTEND-ANGULAR-GAME/README.md)

## Considerations
There are three main ways of handling file uploads:

1- Saving the images directly to your server / static folder (next release of this demo) <br />
2- Saving the imageâ€™s binary data or base64 string data to your database, or Grid FS is a feature in MongoDB <br />
3- Using Amazon Web Service (AWS) S3 buckets, Google Cloud Storage or other storage service to save and manage your images (my recommended option)<br />

## Both Projects have the latest version of dependencies with 0 vulnerabilities :-)
