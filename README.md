## Setup

README API NODE

README FRONTED

## Considerations
There are three main ways of handling file uploads:

1- Saving the images directly to your server / static folder (this demo)
2- Saving the imageâ€™s binary data or base64 string data to your database, or Grid FS is a feature in MongoDB
3- Using Amazon Web Service (AWS) S3 buckets, Google Cloud Storage or other storage service to save and manage your images (my recommended option)

This example uploads a file. I have chosen option 1 to simplify.

## Both Projects have the latest version of dependencies with 0 vulnerabilities :-)
